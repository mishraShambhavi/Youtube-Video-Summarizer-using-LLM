# Youtube-Video-Summarizer-using-LLM
Developed a project that transforms YouTube videos into concise summaries using large language model (LLM). The project employs Streamlit for the interface, the YouTube Transcript API for extracting transcripts, and Google's Gemini model to generate detailed summaries. Users input a YouTube link, and the app provides a coherent summary.
